[日本語版はこちら](./README_ja.md)

This is a simple React-based AI chat application powered by the [AITuber OnAir Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aituber-onair/core) library.  
It allows users to interact with various AI chat models (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) by configuring API keys and model settings through a user-friendly interface.  
The app supports both text and image (vision) chat, and provides real-time assistant responses with partial streaming.  
Key features include:

- Switchable chat providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and models
- API key and system prompt configuration via modal settings
- Text and image (vision) chat support
- Real-time assistant partial response streaming
- Chat history management and clearing

This project is intended as a minimal, easy-to-understand example for integrating AITuber OnAir Core into a modern React application.
